AUV tools by Ian Katz (ijk5@mit.edu)

A collection of python utilities for MOOS (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/MOOS/wiki/pmwiki.php)
and the SWIG bindings which will allow it to run.

Built and tested on Ubuntu Linux; all documentation will assume that OS.

In order to install MOOS-python-utils: 
 0. you will need to apt-get install the following (and maybe more):
      swig 
      python 
      libpython2.6 
      python-mysqldb 
      python-numpy 
      python-scipy 
      python-dev
      libwxgtk2.8-dev
      python-wxgtk2.8
 1. place this directory in the MOOS toplevel directory
 2. run "cmake -i ." in the MOOS directory
 3. add "MOOS-python-utils" to the list of "ALSO_BUILD" directories
 4. build MOOS normally
 5. add the SWIG output to the utils directory.  there are probably better
    ways to do this, but here is how I do it:
        cd utils/
        ln -s ../SwigBindings/pyMOOS.py ./
        ln -s ../../MOOSBin/_pyMOOS.so ./
